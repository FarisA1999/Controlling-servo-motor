# Controlling-servo-motors 
* this task consider a part of making robotic arm

Brief : Controlling 5 servo motors in two ways ( automatically , or by using adjustable resistor).
# Controlling servo motors automatically
The idea of this part is to change the angle of the motors from 90 degree to 0 degree repeatedly.

-At the beginning I  desgined the [circuit](https://github.com/FarisA1999/Controlling-servo-motor/blob/main/control%20servo%20automaticlly_%20circuit.png) using tinkerkad website.

-Then, I write the Arduino [code](https://github.com/FarisA1999/Controlling-servo-motor/commit/12f6ca00262bb20f32d90b6313c1f87ffe10f7b0) to control the servo motors by programming.

 - I had to make some changes on the previous circuit and modify it so we can have [new circuit](https://github.com/FarisA1999/Controlling-servo-motor/blob/main/control%20servo%20by%20resistor_%20circuit.png) that can be controled  by using adjustable resistors.
 
 - Writing a [code to control the motors using the adjustable resistors](https://github.com/FarisA1999/Controlling-servo-motor/blob/main/control%20servo%20by%20resistor%20_code.ino). 

- Here is [simulation video](https://github.com/FarisA1999/Controlling-servo-motor/blob/main/Control%20servo%20by%20resistor_video.mp4) for controlling the motors with adjustable resistors
